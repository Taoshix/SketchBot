## Why are there old modules in the SketchBot/Modules directory?

The old modules in the `SketchBot/Modules` directory are remnants from previous versions of SketchBot from before slash commands were forced upon us. \
They are still accessible via the mention prefix @sketchbot, but they will not be updated or maintained.
